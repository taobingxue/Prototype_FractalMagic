### Tech

- Unity 5.5.1
- Oculus Utilities 1.11.0
- Oculus Avatar sdk 1.10.1 (for Oculus Touch)

- We have included a .gitignore that prevents commiting unnecessary files
- ... And many more!

### Design

Main function will look like a magic circle in center. On the right are functions (represented as elements). On the left are parameters (represented as shapes)
Player can drag the shape into an element to make a function. Player can also duplicate a function and put it into itself/another function to create recursive effect.
Once the function has been set up, player can drop it into the magic circle to watch how fractal grows.

### Todos

 - Fractal Bloom and Merge
 - Detect and remove empty function for function expand
 - ...
